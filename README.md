# Introduction

This repository includes the core conversations (translation tokens) for DailyBot's chatbot. Please notice that our web application is only supporting English and Spanish at the moment, however the chatbot can support more languages, these are the translations included in this project.

We created this open source repo so that you can contribute to the user experience of DailyBot and help us increase the quality of the translations, if you want to introduce a new language, please feel free to propose it.

Question templates (for follow-ups) are not included in this repository. If you have any recommendation regarding the translation of a question template in follow-ups, please open an issue and we'll review it with our product team.

Notice that some translations tokens might be excluded for security reasons.


## Huge thanks
Thank you community for helping us translate the DailyBot chatbot experience into several languages.
